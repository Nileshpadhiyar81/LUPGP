 with this app you can capture(log) holding register integer values using modbus tcpip protocol.
 in modbus protocol there will be a shift so data of register 1 will be shown on register 2 ( this depends on device please check your device manual)
 enter the parameter and click connect then it will start creating dataframe upto user input secs and then it will create report of excel file as
 "report of current date and time,xlsx" into current directory
 the app will take around 10-20 sec cuz it will unzip its runtime files into temporary folder
